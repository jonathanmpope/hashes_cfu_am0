# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

**Not really. The only thing I struggled with was switching syntax with semicolons, hash rockets, and quotations and how that changed methods around changing keys, calling them, etc.**

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

**It's going well. I have like 90 pages of notes from my time learning javascript and learned a lot about best practices when doing that.**

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

**First, I look at my notes or examples from lessons. Then I look at ruby documentation. Finally, if that doesn't solve the problem I go to google. I learn from seeing / understanding / doing, so seeing examples and then understanding the 'why' what I was doing wasn't working and then repeating that type of work a few times is how I learn. I know this, so that's how I try to seek info.**
